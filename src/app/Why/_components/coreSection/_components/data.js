    desc: "Septic tank slab systems are designed to collect, process, treat and dispose of household waste back to nature safely. This treatment system is to avoid environmental pollution, which may lead to environmental-related diseases. Therefore, there is a need to be extremely careful during the installation phase of the system to avoid any future complications. Septic tanks cover slabs are usually very strenuous to construct. Preliminaries like shuttering and formworks have proven hectic to put in place and later demolished. When using the beam and block slab system, the process has been made much easier. The slab is suspended resting on the walls of the septic tank, no erecting and demolishing of the shutters and formworks.",
