      {
        title: "No Reinforcement Required:",
        text: "The Beams are made of Class 60 concrete, pre-stressed with high tensile steel, and manufactured to BS EN 15037, meaning there no need for additional reinforcement. This makes Beam and Block flooring economical.",

        title: "Fast and Easy Installation:",
        text: "The Beam and Block system is very quick and easy to install.  Approximately 100 m2 of the system can be installed manually in a day. For conventional slab, it takes about 28 days for the slab to be completed from concreting, vibrating and curing. This can save about 90% of time. Minimal machinery is required on site. (No Concrete pump, No Poker Vibrator, No raking or levelling required).",

        title: "Minimal Labour / Machinery required:",
        text: " A competent site supervisor and a few unskilled labour are required to install the system. This saves on costs. The beams can be carried and placed by hand, no lifting equipment required.",

        title: "Reduced Theft / loss of Materials from site:",
        text: "The Beam and Block system is uniquely designed for each build, it cannot be used on another site.  It is stored in the open. The risk of theft / loss is minimal compared to steel and cement etc. as used in a conventional slab.",

        title: "Minimum Site Preparation for ground floor foundation:",
        text: "Only excavation of trenches for foundation walling or columns is required.  No removal, cartage and fill and compaction of the ground floor slab as Beam and block is suspended. A minimum Void of 150mm (or 225mm in Black cotton) is required between underside of floor and ground surface. Saving costs and reducing site activity.",

        title: "Early working Platforms and quick progression of works:",
        text: "The floor itself becomes a working platform as soon as it is laid, allowing other works and walling to continue as soon as it is laid.  Plumbing and electrical can be done upon completion of the structure saving time.",
