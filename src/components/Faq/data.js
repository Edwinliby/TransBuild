      question:
        "Is TransBuild better than traditional slab?",
      answer:
        "It is a concrete product we follow the same building guidelines and rules of a conventional slab. We have several advantages over conventional slab when it comes to price and ease of installation etc. Once the floor is completed there is no physical or observable difference between the two.",

      question: "How are the Pre-Stressed beams made?",
      answer:
        "The beams are made of high tensile steel which are stretched, and then concrete is poured over.  After setting, the mechanical force applied during casting is released thereby stressing the wires in the concrete beam thus, the concrete is now effectively in a state of compression. It is capable of counteracting tensile stress, such as load.",

      question:
        "What are the advantages of using your product?",
      answer:
        "The system reduces construction costs whilst maintaining the clientâ€™s expectations and quality of work. The system is faster, cost-effective, with minimum labour, no shuttering is required when compared to the traditional slab.",

      question:
        "Are the beams reinforced?",
      answer:
        "We use of high-tensile steel which is equivalent to D-16 wires as reinforcement.",

      question:
        "What is your standard pricing?",
      answer:
        "The Beams cost around 1,100/= per length metre. However, we require your drawings to give you the full cost. The actual cost varies and will be based on your drawings and technical requirements. Depending on the location transport charges also vary.",

      question:
        "Is TransBuild cheaper than traditional slab?",
      answer:
        "Yes, If you include savings made on preliminaries, speed of build, no formwork, reduced labour, reduction of the total number of delivery vehicles, space-saving on site, low-security risk, all-weather installation, no overtime required, guaranteed quality, Just in time delivery, for low-level housing units no mechanical lifting required, minimal excavation. No mixing on site, No curing, No redundancy requirement for mixers and poker vibrators.",

      question:
        "Can one visit your production yard for familiarization?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we would like to know when you want to visit so that we can arrange with the production manager regarding the same.",
